Project Title:

EXPLORE US BIKESHARE DATA

Description:
Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price.  Motivate is one of the bicycle-sharing system providers for many of the major cities in the United States such as Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC. 

Using data provided by Motivate and randomly selected for the first six months of 2017 for these three large cities, this project computes the following descriptive statistics for them:
- Popular times of travel
- Popular stations and trip
- Trip duration
- User info

Files Used:

The following three city dataset files are used:
- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv
